# rlefer

R package to draw non-overlapping and evenly-spaced curves in a flow field (i.e. vector field)
using the Jobard and Lefer (1997) algorithm. This algorithm is thoroughly described in a scientific paper (Jobard and Lefer 1997), but you might [find this article useful too](https://pedro-faria.netlify.app/posts/2024/2024-02-19-flow-even/en/index.html).
